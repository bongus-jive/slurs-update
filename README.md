starbound's profanity filter (used for name generation) is taken from [`LDNOOBW/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words`](https://github.com/LDNOOBW/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words)

this is just an updated version of the list . they released new slurs 

theyre all rot13ed because i guess chucklefish didnt want slurs in their assets. idk
